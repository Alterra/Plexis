	<h1>WowLib</h1>

	<p>
		A wowlib, or Wow Library, is a framework that contains a list of methods that preform actions on the realm. It is best 
        to describe the wowlib as a "go between", or connection between the cms, and the WoWserver databases. The cms calls 
        upon the requested action to be preformed (A Method in the wowlib class), and the wowlib process the request best 
        suited to the current revision of the core. Each realm can use its own Wowlib, which means you can have multiple 
        realms, all different revisions (Ex: TrinityCore 3.1.3 & TrinityCore 3.3.5a), using its own Optimized wow library! 
        Any core/emulator can be used as long as there is a Wowlib for it. By default, the cms will support Arcemu, TrinityCore, and Mangos.
	</p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Each folder in the "third_party/wowlib" directory is treated as an emulator. Each emulator must contain at least 1 default wowlib, 
        or else selecting the emulator will cause the cms errors! All emulators in this directory, will automatically be listed as a
        selectable emulator in the admin panel of this cms. Each wowlib in the emulator folders is optimized
        for a certain span of core revisions... Whenever a core update happens, that changes a table
        for example, a new updated wowlib will need to be created so the cms will still be able to do
        the requested actions without error.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>
        Each emulator, must contain a "realm" or "core" class ( {emulator}/{Emulator}.php ). The realm class is
        used to provide basic realm and account actions, such as getting a formated realmlist, verifying login information, 
        banning accounts, and changing an account password / email. The realm class needs to be namespaced in the "Wowlib" namespace. 
        To get an idea of what you need to do to add a custom emulator, its best to just copy an emulator in 
        this directory, and use it as a template to make your own.
